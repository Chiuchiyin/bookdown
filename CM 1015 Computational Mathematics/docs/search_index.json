[["00-how-to-prove-it.html", "How to Prove It", " How to Prove It One of the largest stumbling block in studying mathematics is learning how to prove theorems. In this post, I would share with you 3 of the most commonly used technique with at least one step by step example. Direct proof Perhaps the most intuitive and straightforward way to write proofs. It goes by “If A, then B” or “A implies B” or mathematically A \\(\\Rightarrow\\) B. For example: The sum of two even numbers is also even. Proof: Let \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) be even numbers. Since they are even, by definition they can be rewritten as \\(2n\\) and \\(2m\\) respectively. Thus, the sum \\(x+y = 2n+2m = 2(n+m)\\), which is even number by definition. Third Binomial Formula Proof: \\[\\begin{align} (a-b)\\cdot (a+b)&amp;= a\\cdot a+a\\cdot b-b \\cdot a-b \\cdot b\\\\ &amp;= a^2+a \\cdot b-b \\cdot a-b^2\\\\ &amp;= a^2-b^2 \\end{align}\\] Square of odd number is also odd Proof: Let \\(x\\) be odd numbers. Since it is odd, by definition it can be rewritten as \\(2n+1\\). Thus the square product \\(x^2 = (2n+1)^2 = 4n^2+4n+1 = 2(2n^2+2n)+1\\) which is an odd number by definition. Indirect proof or proof by contradiction An elegant way to write a proof that might seem counter intuitive at first. It is also known as proof by contradiction and reductio ad impossibile. It goes the following steps: Mathematical Induction Mathematical induction is usually taught together with series and sequences. It is a powerful tool to prove series and sequences. It is split into two steps: "]]
