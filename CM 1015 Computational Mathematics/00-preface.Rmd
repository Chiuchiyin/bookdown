# Preface {-}

This material is based on the October 2022 version of the course, so some content may not reflect the most current edition. Most of it comes from my own handwritten notes.

Personally, I think the course would be more accurately titled “Foundational Mathematics” rather than “Computational Mathematics,” since it leaves out numerical methods (and probably other topics people more familiar with the field could point out).

If you notice any errors, please feel free to reach out to me via Slack or email.

*P.S. Chapter 4 has been delayed for ages because I’ve been too lazy to redraw all the triangles by hand.*
